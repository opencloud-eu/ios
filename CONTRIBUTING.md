### Guidelines
* [Report the issue](https://github.com/opencloud/ios-app/issues/new) using our [template][template], it includes all the informations we need to track down the issue.
* This repository is *only* for issues within the OpenCloud iOS app code. Issues in other components should be reported in their own repositores: 
  - [OpenCloud core](https://github.com/opencloud/core/issues)
  - [Android client](https://github.com/opencloud/android/issues)
  - [Desktop client](https://github.com/opencloud/client/issues)
  - [OpenCloud apps](https://github.com/opencloud/apps/issues) (e.g. Calendar, Contacts...)
* Search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
